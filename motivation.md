# Motivation

This section is the first in the tutorial. It serves to explain why we need to write the Security Considerations section:
* Security is important in *any* protocol (not just security protocols)
* The ways security issues may affect implementations of your specifications is not obvious.
* RFC 2223 requires such a section
* SecDir reviews and Security ADs review is part of the publication process
