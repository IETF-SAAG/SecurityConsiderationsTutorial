Outline for a Security Considerations Sunday Tutorial

This is the table of contents for the Sunday tutorial that we would like to make.

Sunday tutorials are typically 1 hour long. With all the introduction, Note Well, and other stuff, we should be able to plan for 55 minutes.

I've started a page for each of the sections of the tutorial. Each page will have several titled sections, which will map to a series of 1-5 slides, and eventually we're going to have an outline for what will later become a slide.  These pages will also contain commentary about what should be said and how it should be said.

*Issues, pull requests, and discussion on the SAAG list are very much welcome.*
