# What goes into a Security Considerations Section

This part of the tutorial tells what things should be covered in the section. Some of it is based on RFC 3552, some may be based on the -00 [draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nir-saag-rfc3552bis-00) that tried to revise 3552; and some may be new.
