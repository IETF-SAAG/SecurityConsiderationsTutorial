# History
(of the Security Considerations requirement)

How did we get here...


## RFC 2223
(1 slide)
```
9. Security Considerations Section
   All RFCs must contain a section near the end of the document that
   discusses the security considerations of the protocol or procedures
   that are the main topic of the RFC.
```

## RFC 3552
(2-3 slides)


## Changes since then
(2-3 slides)
